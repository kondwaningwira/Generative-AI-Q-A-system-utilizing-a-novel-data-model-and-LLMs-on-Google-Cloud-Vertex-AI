Prior research has found that a change in asset turnover is positively related to future changes in earnings. [6] Over three years, the figures of ROE and ROA rose rapidly (table 11&12), especially ROE. Return on equity is the product of return on assets and leverage ratio. The leverage ratios also showed a slightly increase to nearly one in 2022, indicating that company has utilize the financial leverage to operate better and generate more profits.The impressing performance in ROE primarily duo to the increase of ROA.

These two accounting ratios measure different constructs and, accordingly, have different properties. Prior research has found that a change in asset turnover is positively related to future changes in earnings. [6] Over three years, the figures of ROE and ROA rose rapidly (table 11&12), especially ROE. Return on equity is the product of return on assets and leverage ratio. The leverage ratios also showed a slightly increase to nearly one in 2022, indicating that company has utilize the financial leverage to operate better and generate more profits.The impressing performance in ROE primarily duo to the increase of ROA. When analyzing the ROA, we can see that the net profit margin has increased from 2.29% in 2020 to 15.41% in 2022. This means that Tesla has improved its ability to generate profit from its larger\n",

            "In terms of geography, the majority of Tesla's revenue comes from the United States and China. Tesla's revenue in China has grown rapidly, with 2021 sales revenue in the United States, China, and other regions being $24 billion, $138 billion, and $16 billion, respectively, accounting for 45%, 26%, and 30%. The completion and production of the Tesla Shanghai Gigafactory in 2019 greatly boosted its production capacity, resulting in a cost advantage. With a lower cost per car, Tesla's products have become more competitive in the market, especially with the promotion of green card policies and new energy subsidies in China. [4]As a result, Tesla's sales in the region have experienced significant growth.\n",

The debt to equity and capital ratio decrease a impressing degree, which means Tesla has reduced its debt levels. The interest coverage ratio in 2022 was 72.83, which shows the company is generating enough income to cover its interest expenses. This is a significant improvement in company’s financial performance compared to 2021(18.10) and 2020(2.54).
